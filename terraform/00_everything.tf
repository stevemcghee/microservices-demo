# Enable GKE in the project we created. If you look at the docs you might see

# enabled for your project. Otherwise it will disable services you might be

# First we create the cluster. If you're wondering where all the sizing details
# are, they're below in the `google_container_node_pool` resource. We'll get

#
# One thing to note here is the name of the resource ("gke") is only used
# internally, for instance when you're referencing the resource (eg
# `google_container_cluster.gke.id`). The actual created resource won't know
# about it, and in fact you can specify the name for that in the resource
# itself.
#
# Finally, there are many, many other options available. The resource below
# replicates what the Hipster Shop README creates. If you want to see what else
# is possible, check out the docs: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/container_cluster.html

  # Using an embedded resource to define the node pool. Another
  # option would be to create the node pool as a separate resource and link it
  # to this cluster. There are tradeoffs to each approach.
  #
  # The embedded resource is convenient but if you change it you have to te
  # down the entire cluster and rebuild it. A separate resource could be
  # modified independent of the cluster without the cluster needing to be torn
  # down.
  #
  # For this particular case we're not going to be modifying the node pool once
  # it's deployed, so it makes sense to accept the tradeoff for the convenience
  # of having it inline.
